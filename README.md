# casio-fx-9750GII
This repo features programs I wrote for my graphing calculator, most notably a fully working iteration of the game "Snake". The single file in the repo is a duplicate of my calculator memory with propriety encoding, which can only be opened with the Casio FA-124 software, a real calculator or an emulator.
